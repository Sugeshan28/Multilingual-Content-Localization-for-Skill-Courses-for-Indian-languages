 Rabbit and Crow, a one minute story. Once upon a time, there was a rabbit. He always tried to copy other animals. One day he saw a crow. The crow was sitting on a tree and doing nothing. Rabbit thought to do the same. He said on the ground and doing nothing when a fox saw him. Fox came near and ate him. For a lot of the stories, do sit and do nothing you need to be on top.
